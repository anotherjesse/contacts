== BEFORE YOU CONTINUE

If you just cloned this samples directory using Git, you need to run the
following two commands to get the latest version of SproutCore JavaScript:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Then create an config/database.yml and run the migrations

== GOAL

Show how to combine all the pieces for both frameworks.
