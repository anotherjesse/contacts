And the contacts application from the sproutcore-samples

  http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-samples/

== BEFORE YOU CONTINUE

Install sproutcore: sudo gem install sproutcore

If you just cloned this samples directory using Git, you need to run the
following two commands to get the latest version of SproutCore JavaScript:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Then create an config/database.yml and run initialize the database

  rake db:migrate
  rake db:fixtures:load

== Starting up the servers

Startup rails as normal (script/server)

Startup sproutcore development mode server:

  cd sprout && sc-server

http://localhost:4020/contacts

== Building static version

From the sprout directory running sc-build will create 

  sprout/tmp/build/static

This static directory can be moved into your rails public
directory, then you can run with a static html/css/js, talking
to the rails server via json.

  cp -r sprout/tmp/build/static public

or

  ln -s ../sprout/tmp/build/static/ public/

Then you can access it via

  http://localhost:3000/static/contacts
